        <h2 id="nodes-without-traffic">Nodes Without Traffic</h2>
        <p>
            This chart shows the percentage of nodes that haven't been receiving any traffic despite being continuously
            active for a given period. For example, to estimate it for 2 hour period we take all the nodes that were
            continuously reported as active by the <a href="https://orchestrator.strn.pl/stats">orchestrator API</a>
            during
            the
            past 2 hours. For every node ID in this list, we calculate its traffic for the past 2 hours using the <a
                href="https://uc2x7t32m6qmbscsljxoauwoae0yeipw.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws">lambda
                API</a> that is used by <a href="https://dashboard.saturn.tech/address/all">Saturn Dashboard</a>.
            The result is the ratio between nodes without traffic and the active nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Gaps and spikes on the chart might be caused by several reasons. Including but not limited to issues with
            our
            API scrapper, issues with the orchestrator or the lambda API, or issues with the Saturn network itself.

        <h2 id="traffic-ratio">Paid Traffic Ratio</h2>
        <p>
            This chart shows the ratio between outgoing Saturn network traffic (considered as "paid") and the total
            outgoing
            traffic served by nodes. Total outgoing traffic is estimated using network interface stats reported by the
            <a href="https://orchestrator.strn.pl/stats">orchestrator API</a>. Paid traffic is estimated using the <a
                href="https://uc2x7t32m6qmbscsljxoauwoae0yeipw.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws">lambda
                API</a> that is used by <a href="https://dashboard.saturn.tech/address/all">Saturn Dashboard</a>.

        <h2 id="earnings-and-traffic-distribution">Earnings & Traffic Distribution</h2>
        <p>
            To construct this chart, first, we calculate earnings and traffic for every node that was reported as
            "active"
            by the <a href="https://orchestrator.strn.pl/stats">orchestrator API</a> during the month. Earnings and
            traffic
            are estimated using info scrapped from the <a
                href="https://uc2x7t32m6qmbscsljxoauwoae0yeipw.lambda-url.us-west-2.on.aws">lambda
                API</a> that is used by <a href="https://dashboard.saturn.tech/address/all">Saturn Dashboard</a>. Then
            we
            create two lists of node IDs, sorted in descending order. One is sorted by earnings, and another
            one is sorted by traffic. Now, for each node in each list, we calculate what percentage of the network this
            node
            and the nodes above it in the list make up. We plot this value on the X asix. On the Y axis, for each node
            in
            each list, we plot the cumulative percentage of earnings and traffic this node and the nodes above it in the
            list receive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefore, we have the chart that shows that X percent of the network receives Y percent of the network's
            traffic or earnings.
